Real-life indoor 3D WIFI-beacon dataset construction using autonomous low-cost robot for artificial neural network 3D location estimation

Abstract: 

Datasets used for Artificial Neural Network and Machine Learning applications play vital role in the research and application of such techniques into solving real-life problems. The construction and availability of large datasets to be used in the off-line phase of ANN training is usually a crucial and time-consuming step towards the system construction. In this work, framework for autonomous construction of a diverse, extensive, and open dataset with built-in redundancy is demonstrated. As part of the framework, a low-cost robot using off-the-shelf components is built which constructs the dataset autonomously. The robot includes a controller network with multiple wifi transceiver nodes for collecting received signal strength indicator (RSSI) at various elevation points through the building. All nodes are configured with direct internet access to streamline the data collection towards an online database which is constructed as part of this framework. Preliminary validation and analysis of the dataset is discussed along with an exploration of application domain of such dataset.
